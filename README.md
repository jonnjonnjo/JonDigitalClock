# Digital-Clock

Here's a Digital Clock HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I actually take the code from someone's project.

Here's the source :

I also use background from game named [Firewatch](https://www.firewatchgame.com/)

# Some Features that I've added
- Changing background and clock color if it's between AM an PM


# Some Features that I might add in the future
- Changing the clock based on where you are 
- Adding the date and animation the that date
- Adding animation each second ( kinda pop / splash animatinon ) to the clock box
